## OS
HiGHS can be used on Windows, Linux and MacOS.

## Compilers

HiGHS can be used with the following compilers:

- Clang ` clang `
- GNU ` g++ ` 
- Intel ` icc `

## Dependencies

No third party sortware is required by HiGHS apart from Threads for the parallel solve.

In order to build HiGHS from source CMake 3.15 is required. For precompiled executables and libraries please contact us at [highsopt@gmail.com](mailto:highsopt@gmail.com).

## Specification

HiGHS solves large scale sparse linear programming (LP) problems of the form
```math
\textrm{min} \qquad c^Tx \qquad \textrm{subject to} \qquad L <= Ax <= U; \qquad l <= x <= u.
```

The HiGHS core solver implementes the dual revised simplex method in parallel C++. An interior point solver is available as an optional feature.
